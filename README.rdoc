= Knife AWS Extensions

= Description:

This is the Chef Knife plugin adding new commands for AWS.

= Installation:

Be sure you are running the latest version Chef. Versions earlier than 0.10.0 don't support plugins:

    gem install chef

To install:

    gem install specific_install
    gem specific_install https://github.com/radekg/knife-aws-extensions.git

Depending on your system's configuration, you may need to run this command with root privileges.

= Configuration:

In order to communicate with the Amazon's EC2 API you will have to tell Knife about your AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to create some entries in your <tt>knife.rb</tt> file:

    knife[:aws_access_key_id]  = "Your AWS Access Key ID"
    knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = "Your AWS Secret Access Key"

If your knife.rb file will be checked into a SCM system (ie readable by others) you may want to read the values from environment variables:

    knife[:aws_access_key_id] = "#{ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']}"
    knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = "#{ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']}"

= Subcommands:

This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands.  Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a <tt>--help</tt> flag

== knife ec2 security group create

== knife ec2 security group delete

== knife ec2 security group list
